      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Who is Jk Rowling</i></p><br>
      <p>Joanne Rowling was born in Yate General Hospitak on the 31st July 1965
        She wanted to be a writer from an early age. She wrote her first book at just 6 years old – a story about a rabbit, called ‘Rabbit’. Age eleven, she wrote her first novel – about seven cursed diamonds and the people who owned them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jo studied at Exeter University, where she read so widely outside her French and Classics syllabus that she clocked up a fine of £50 for overdue books at the University library. Her knowledge of Classics would one day come in handy for creating the spells in the Harry Potter series, some of which are based on Latin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jo conceived the idea of Harry Potter in 1990 while sitting on a delayed train from Manchester to London King’s Cross. Over the next five years, she began to map out all seven books of the series. She wrote mostly in longhand and gradually built up a mass of notes, many of which were scribbled on odd scraps of paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        J.K. Rowling has also written two small companion volumes, which appear as the titles of Harry’s school books within the novels. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages were published in March 2001 in aid of Comic Relief.  In December 2008, a third companion volume, The Tales of Beedle the Bard was published in aid of her international children’s charity, Lumos.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012, J.K. Rowling’s digital company Pottermore was launched, which became Wizarding World Digital in 2019. Pottermore Publishing continues to be the global digital publisher of Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts and the Wizarding World. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2020, J.K. Rowling and Wizarding World partners launched the Harry Potter At Home initiative to entertain children stuck at home during the Covid-19 pandemic with the first Harry Potter book read aloud by celebrities on video, and made available for free through audiobook and ebook streaming.  In May 2020, she announced another initiative to help families in lockdown – The Ickabog, a story for younger children serialised for free online, and an accompanying illustration competition.  A book of The Ickabog featuring the winning children’s illustrations will be published in November 2020, with J.K. Rowling’s royalties going to charities assisting vulnerable groups affected by the pandemic.
